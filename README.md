# Welcome to: Project Betelguese
This project was created as an exploration into full stack development and some javascript practice.
Expect to see this first as a quick and dirty web-based engineering portfolio, then as a way to mess around 
with neat things like p5.js, and web-based implementations of my projects. There also might be a blog or something on here, a collection of art I create to let other cretive juices flow, and, *no promises*, a store for some of the art if I like it enough. Working to add in Agile development to get familiar, we shall see how it goes.
